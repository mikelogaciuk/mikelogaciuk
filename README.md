## About me

I am DataOps Engineer from :poland: workin at [TERG S.A. (MediaExpert)](https://mediaexpert.pl).

I am currently working on Python & SQL :heartpulse: projects.

Since my job is to obtain and move or wrangle specific sales data between POS & ERP systems, altogether with many integrity reports and because of my `NDA` - It's hard for me to share my code as others.

However I plan to cover it up with some things in future :smile:!
