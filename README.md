## About me

I am DataOps Engineer from :poland: Poland working for [TERG S.A. (MediaExpert)](https://mediaexpert.pl).

My job there is to write various integrity checks around our sales data, wrangle it or analyse and visualize for internal purposes, alerts or healthchecks.

Since my job is to:

- obtain and move or wrangle specific sales data between POS & ERP systems,
- altogether with many integrity reports,
- and because of my **NDA**.

It's hard for me to share internal code as others.

However I plan to cover it up with some custom things in future :smile:!
