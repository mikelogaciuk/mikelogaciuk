## About me

I am DataOps Engineer from :poland: working at [TERG S.A. (MediaExpert)](https://mediaexpert.pl).

I usually write various integrity checks around our sales data, altogether with API's.
I am familiar with data modeling, wrangling, moving it out from one place into another.

:x: Since my job is to:

:asterisk: obtain and move or wrangle specific sales data between POS & ERP systems,
:asterisk: altogether with many integrity reports,
:asterisk: and because of my **NDA**.

:interrobang: It's hard for me to share internal code as others.

:hash: However I plan to cover it up with some custom things in future :smile:!
