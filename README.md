# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Why my GIT is so private?

Well to be honest, most of a code I write is for internal purposes only and can not be shared and used in public.

Another thing is that while you work for 8-10 hours per day - you want to rest or learn something new in order to use during your another work day.

You can read my few articles on [Hashnode.dev](https://mlog.hashnode.dev/).
